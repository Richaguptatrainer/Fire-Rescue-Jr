<h1> motor driver works by using an H-bridge circuit to control the direction and speed of DC motors with signals from a microcontroller. </h1>
<h2> what are the components used inside a water motor </h2>
<p1> H-Bridge Transistors – switches that control current flow direction through the motor. <br/>
Input Pins (Logic Control) – receive signals from a microcontroller (like Arduino). <br/>
Enable Pins – turn motor channels ON or OFF and allow speed control with PWM. <br/>
Output Pins – connect to the motor terminals. <br/>
Diodes (Clamp/Freewheeling) – protect against back-EMF when motors stop or change direction. <br/>
Power Supply Pins – one for logic voltage (5V) and one for motor voltage (up to 36V). <br/>
Ground Pins – common ground connection for motor and logic circuits. </p1>
